~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=There's a born mystic among us. A soul who can touch with immortal flames and not shrink. Who hungers after mysteries, lit from within with that eldritch spark...\n\nLet this individual step forward now, and be known.
~02~~panel_001~1_narration=<volunteer> spent days in front of the hearth, days of voiceless vigor, sweating and poring over what passages might be discerned in the archaic swamp of ancient letters. <Volunteer.mf:He/She/They> tended the flames, and spelled theories in their smoke.\n\nWhen <volunteer.mf:he/she/they> began to pull a pattern out of the misty legend, it surprised even <volunteer.mf:him/her/them>. The pattern began to glow in everything: fire, stone, wood, water, horizon, shade, soil. It was there to read in all life and matter. This language, these symbols, they were not a flock of mere ideas, they were a translation of life's essences into ink...\n\nWho can say how first it happened? One moment, <volunteer> was sunk deep into <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> chair and pondering, the next <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> eyebrows were embers and the rug was on fire.\n\nA strange luminescence is there, far star in <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> gaze. And from <volunteer>'s lips, words are smiled into fire and noise.
