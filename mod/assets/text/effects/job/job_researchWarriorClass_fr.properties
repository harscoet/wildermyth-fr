~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Maybe... maybe fighting is just like milking a cow, like shoeing a horse, or telling tales? The more you practice, the better you get.\n\nWhich two among us exhibit the ferocity and fortitude of fighters? Who is courageous to a fault, indomitable of heart and body, a warrior in every sense?
~02~~panel_001~1_narration=<volunteer.1> and <volunteer.2> had a terrific montage at <site>: sparring, acquiring posture and form, practicing technique, and becoming acquainted with the demands of real weapons and armor.\n\nIn their graduating bout, <volunteer.1> was the aggressor. <volunteer.1.mf:he/she/they> pressed the attack, struck glancing blows on helmet-side and shoulder, and almost claimed the match outright with a fast overhead swipe.\n\n<Volunteer.2>, however, showed excellent poise and proficiency with <volunteer.2.mf:his/her/their> shield, giving ground but gaining advantage, and finally knocked <volunteer.1> off balance and off <volunteer.1.mf:his/her/their> feet. Companions to the end, <volunteer.2> helped <volunteer.1> up, and they clasped hands.\n\nThey will always remember this moment, this day. The day they became warriors, of flesh, metal, and will.
