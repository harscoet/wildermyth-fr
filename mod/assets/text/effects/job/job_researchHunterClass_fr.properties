~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Who of us has the pluck and wisdom of the great hunters? Who can tell one fern from another, can hit a hart's mark from a hundred paces?\n\nMost importantly, who looks good in all-leather?

Seeing <volunteer> had woken, <Volunteer.awm:she,he> smiled. "You have the wisdom to follow your heart. You know how to read the signs, and to listen to the land when no other guide can help you.

Only this final whisper... "Teach... anotherrr..."
