~01~prompt~panel_001~1_bookish=Someone should investigate the markings on this rock.
~02~~panel_001~1_narration=<participant> spends countless hours by the stone, trying to decipher some meaning behind the ancient images.
~02~~panel_002~1_narration=So fascinated <participant.mf:is he/is she/are they>, that days and nights slip by.
~02~~panel_003~1_greedy=Any luck?
~02~~panel_004~1_participant=<participant.bookish.60/leader:Yes, actually! My research has been quite fruitful!/Ah, <greedy>! I'm glad you're here! >
~02~~panel_005~1_participant=<participant.bookish/goofball/leader:See, this right here? /Check this out!/Have a look at this!> It's an origin story! It says that the dragons came to our world from another one!
~02~~panel_006~1_participant=They fell from the sky in a huge meteor! When the meteor struck, it shattered into thousands of pieces, and each piece unfolded into a dragon!
~02~~panel_007~1_greedy=<greedy.snark/bookish:Great. Huge lizard-monster-\nthings can fall from the sky./Can't say as I've heard that tale before.> That's where dragons came from?
~02~~panel_008~1_participant=Maybe! And maybe not! You see this one here?
~02~~panel_009~1_participant=It says that the dragons were inSIDE of our world, and clawed their way to the surface!
~02~~panel_010~1_participant=And this one over here says that they were the mounts of ancient gods, who warred with each other in the skies!
~02~~panel_011~1_greedy=So ... which one is it?
~02~~panel_012~1_participant=Yeah, I have no idea. Neither did the people who drew these images.
~02~~panel_013~1_greedy=<greedy.leader/snark/healer:So this was a waste of time? /Sounds like you wasted a few days of your life .../I hope you're not too upset that you wasted your time.>
~02~~panel_013~2_participant=Oh no! Not at all. Look at this.
~02~~panel_014~1_greedy=Is that a ... yeah, I have no idea what that is. <greedy.greedy/60:Doesn't look very valuable./Looks kinda worthless?>
~02~~panel_015~1_participant=<participant.goofball/healer/60:Are you kidding? This is a Drauven ceremonial bowl!/It's an offering of herbs! This particular one is known for its bone strengthening properties./They're Drauven bone beads! Very important ceremonially.>
~02~~panel_016~1_participant=According to this, they were either worshipping these long forgotten creatures ...
~02~~panel_017~1_participant=Or trying to bring them back to life!
~02~~panel_018~1_participant=I know! Isn't it great! Come on, let's go!
~02~~panel_018~2_greedy=Did you just say, "back to life"?
