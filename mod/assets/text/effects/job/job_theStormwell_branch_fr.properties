~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<npc> and <npc2> welcomed <volunteer> and stuffed <volunteer.mf:him/her/them> full of bristleberry pie and goat cheese while they waited for a storm to roll in.
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_actionSmall=[gray]rummmble..
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_npc=Right, this is more like it...
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_npc=<npc2>! Get your boots.
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_action=[navy]Behhh.
~01~prompt~panel_003~3_volunteer=You stay.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_actionSmall=[gray]rrrumbbllle...
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=<npc> tinkered with the top of the Stormwell.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_npc2=Careful.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_actionSmall=[gray]rrrumble...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_npc=Wonderful! Good sign. Almost there.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_actionSmall=[purple]boommm...
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_npc2=You call us when you're ready.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_action=brrrmmmm
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc2=So... What'd you give up?
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_volunteer=For?
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_npc2=The whole... Heroing.
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_npc2=You know, like your goats or your spouse, to name examples at random.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_volunteer=Oh.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(lover_exists)~1_volunteer=I got lucky, I guess. <lover>’s out here too, so I’ve gained more than I’ve lost.
~01~prompt~panel_016.(lover_exists)~2_npc2=Convenient.
~01~prompt~panel_017.(lover_exists)~1_volunteer=<volunteer.age.45:We’re getting older, though, so/We’ve got a lot of time ahead, but> who knows.
~01~prompt~panel_018.(lover_exists)~1_volunteer=Maybe one of us will have to bow out someday.
~01~prompt~panel_019.(lover_exists)~1_volunteer=There’ll be discussions.
~01~prompt~panel_020.(lover_exists)~2_volunteer=Or maybe things will have settled down for good and it won’t be an issue.
~01~prompt~panel_021.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_snark)~1_volunteer=...Plausible deniability.
~01~prompt~panel_021.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_snark)~2_npc2=What?
~01~prompt~panel_021.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_snark)~3_volunteer=Nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_022.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_snark)~1_volunteer=There’s a <volunteer> out there, in another time, who maybe got some goats and a <volunteer.awm:wife/husband/spouse>.
~01~prompt~panel_023.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_snark)~1_volunteer=Maybe <volunteer.mf:he was/she was/they were> even happy.
~01~prompt~panel_024.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_snark)~1_volunteer=I’ll never know <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> story. But this one’s mine.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_loner)~1_volunteer=...Plausible deniability.
~01~prompt~panel_025.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_loner)~2_npc2=What?
~01~prompt~panel_025.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_loner)~3_volunteer=Nothing.
~01~prompt~panel_026.(lover_is_missing).(volunteer_is_loner)~1_volunteer=There’s a <volunteer> out there, in another time, who maybe got some goats and a <volunteer.awm:wife/husband/spouse>.

~01~prompt~panel_029.(lover_is_missing).(fallback_(80))~1_volunteer=<volunteer.personality:I’ve reread “The Founding of <volunteer.hometown>” twenty times now, because it turns out books are heavy. You can’t carry many with you out here. I had whole shelves at home. A writing desk too./For a while, I thought I gave up security. But then I realized that if things are this bad, maybe the security was an illusion. Not that—I mean, this place is safe! For now. Anyway. Wait, is that what you asked?/<volunteer.age.40:My wrists. My knees. My charming, youthful exuberance./Sleeping in. Leisurely breakfast. Someday I'll get back to the tavern where <npc3> cooks the eggs the way I like them.> /I don’t think about it like that. I think, “What’s out here to [i]gain?[] What’’ll slip into the mists if ol’ <volunteer> doesn’t get in there first?”/It sounds silly, but I think about my garden and my old cat. If they wonder where I went. Old cats and tomato plants are both known for their dislike of change./I don't think about it like that. I think, "What's out here to [i]gain?[] What'll slip into the mists of time if ol' <volunteer> doesn't get in there first?"/I was going to teach the <npc3.lastname>’s kid how to throw a pot on the wheel. <npc3.mf:He was/She was/They were> excited, but I got busy with other duties, then this all happened. Not a big thing, sure, but I think about it./--/A million lives, all my own. But there’s no avoiding it./There was a quiet <volunteer.awm:girl/boy> in <volunteer.hometown>, we used to work fences together. Dark hair. I never told <volunteer.awm:her/him> how striking it was. Somebody else probably has by now./-->

~01~prompt~panel_033~2_narration=<volunteer>'s musings are sharply interrupted.
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_npc2=[i]<npc>![]
~01~prompt~panel_035~1_action=vwoop!
~01~prompt~panel_037~1_npc=It's been a long flower to bloom, but it's quite pretty now, isn't it?
~01~prompt~panel_038~1_narration=The Stormwell fills with light, or water, or both. It swirls and spills over the sides.
~01~prompt~panel_038~2_npc=Probably not.
~01~prompt~panel_038~3_volunteer=I should have asked this before, but am I going to have to fight something?
~01~prompt~panel_039~1_volunteer=What happens now, then?
~01~prompt~panel_040~1_npc=Well? Um. That wasn't in the stories.
~01~prompt~panel_040~2_npc=The ancient voices of the tempest aren't telling you?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_narration=Take a drink.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_darken=[green]Transform (Head)
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_narration=Reach in.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_darken=[green]Transform (Arm)
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_narration=Step in.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=[green]Transform (Leg)
~05~choice_four~panel_001~1_volunteer=Guess not.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_narration=<volunteer> draws <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> face close to the water. Tiny flashes within it hold <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> gaze.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=Suddenly it's obvious what <volunteer.mf:he's/she's/they're> supposed to do.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_action=*gulp*
~06~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_volunteer=A little metallic. Not great, honestly.
~06~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_npc=How, um. How'd it taste?
~06~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_volunteer=...You both okay?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_narration=<volunteer> extends <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> arm into the cold water...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=and shock snaps up through <volunteer.mf:his/her/their> shoulder.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_narration=Feeling fades to static...
~07~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=[purple]...then swells to power.
~07~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_npc=You think that would’ve looked good on me?
~07~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_npc2=Might've made milking goats harder.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_narration=<volunteer> removes a boot and dips a toe into the well.
~08~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_npc=What would've happened if <volunteer.mf:he'd/she'd/they'd> sat all the way in?
~08~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_npc2=Perhaps it's better that we'll never know.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_001~1_npc4=And you know, I've been thinking.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_002~1_volunteer=About what really makes a hero. And perhaps... perhaps we've all learned an important lesson today.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_003~1_volunteer=A lesson about identity and... um..
~09~player_chose_four~panel_003~2_actionSmall=Behh.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_004~1_action=Behhhh.
~09~player_chose_four~panel_005~1_action=[white]Splash!
~09~player_chose_four~panel_006~1_actionLarge=[darkBlue]Behh!
~09~player_chose_four~panel_006~2_actionLarge=[dark]Behh!
